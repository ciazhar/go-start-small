# Open Telemetry + Jaeger

OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry
data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

Jaeger: open source, distributed tracing platform
Monitor and troubleshoot workflows in complex distributed systems

Distributed tracing observability platforms, such as Jaeger, are essential for modern software applications that are
architected as microservices. Jaeger maps the flow of requests and data as they traverse a distributed system. These
requests may make calls to multiple services, which may introduce their own delays or errors. Jaeger connects the dots
between these disparate components, helping to identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot errors, and improve
overall application reliability. Jaeger is 100% open source, cloud native, and infinitely scalable.
